<p>Sentiment analysis (SA) is one of the most trending research areas in Artificial Intelligence (AI). Sentiment analysis is a technique used to identify the sentiments contained in natural language, which is mostly shared on social media platforms. A lot has been achieved in sentiment analysis research, focusing mostly on Rich-Resource Languages like English, German, and Arabic. However, there is little research on many Low Resources Languages. Consequently, we embarked on a mission to promote research on SA in languages spoken in Nigeria, which are all low resources languages. Our research was found worthy by Lacuna Fund, and they supported our team to develop sentiment corpus, sentiment lexicon, and hate speech lexicon for Hausa, Yoruba, and Igbo languages. These are important resources required in sentiment analysis in any language. The project is ongoing, notwithstanding, this article summarizes some of the challenges we faced in the study.</p>
