I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at Northeastern Universityâ€™s Institute for Experiential AI, where I lead research at the intersection of natural language processing (NLP) and computational social science. My work focuses on addressing linguistic and cultural disparities in AI systems, particularly for low-resource African languages. I have developed foundational resources such as [AfriHate](https://github.com/AfriHate/AfriHate), the first multilingual hate speech detection dataset spanning 18 African languages, and [ArtElingo-28](https://www.artelingo.org/artelingo-28-emnlp24), a multimodal benchmark for emotion analysis in 28 languages. My recent projects investigate the cultural alignment of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, including studies on Hausa cultural norms and cross-cultural mixed-emotion representations. I also organized shared tasks at SemEval to advance emotion detection methodologies.

As a co-founder of [HausaNLP](https://hausanlp.github.io) and [Arewa Data Science](https://arewadatascience.github.io), I collaborate with researchers and practitioners to advance NLP and data science initiatives for underserved languages and communities in Africa. Prior to joining Northeastern, I served as an Assistant Professor at Bayero University Kano, where I taught courses in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and database systems, while mentoring graduate students in projects ranging from fake news detection to predictive modeling. My PhD research at Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia used predictive models for movie revenue using social media analytics.

My work has been supported by over $400,000 in competitive grants from organizations like Google Research, Lacuna Fund, and Oracle, and recognized with awards such as the ACII 2025 Best Paper Award. Committed to equitable AI, I design frameworks to mitigate bias in multilingual NLP and foster global collaborations, including organizing low-resource language tracks at conferences like IWSLT.
