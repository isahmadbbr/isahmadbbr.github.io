I am an incoming Assistant Professor in the Department of Computing and New Media Technologies at UW–Stevens Point. From 2023 to 2025, I was a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at Northeastern University’s Institute for Experiential AI, where I led research at the intersection of natural language processing (NLP) and computational social science. My work focused on addressing linguistic and cultural disparities in AI systems, particularly for low-resource languages. 


During my postdoc, I developed foundational resources, including [AfriHate](https://github.com/AfriHate/AfriHate) and [ArtElingo-28](https://www.artelingo.org/artelingo-28-emnlp24), and worked on the cultural alignment of large language models (LLMs). I also co-organized SemEval shared tasks.

I co-founded [HausaNLP](https://hausanlp.github.io) and [Arewa Data Science](https://arewadatascience.github.io), initiatives that enable me to collaborate with researchers and practitioners to advance NLP and data science for low-resource languages. 

From 2014 to 2023, I served as a lecturer at Bayero University Kano, where I taught courses in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and database systems, and mentored graduate students on research projects. During my PhD at Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, I proposed predictive models for movie revenue prediction using social media data.

My work has been supported by over $400,000 in competitive grants from Google Research, Lacuna Fund, and Oracle. One of my papers was also selected as the Best Paper in the ACII 2025 conference, and another received Honorable Mention for Best Paper in SemEval 2024, as part of Shared Task I co-organized.
